# Hello World!

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm Tyler, a passionate developer with a strong interest in JavaScript and back-end development. Over the past two years, I've been honing my skills and I'm excited to continue learning and growing in this field. My ultimate goal is to transition into full-time development.

## About Me

I'm passionate about bringing my ideas to life through code and love sharing my projects for feedback and improvement. In addition to my web development work, Iâ€™ve written hundreds of batch scripts and games on Windows. While these may be a bit dated, I find the challenges they present both fun and rewarding. I thrive on problem-solving and constantly pushing my skills further.

I have earned several certifications via [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
