  <p>I'm Tyler, and I want to put my ideas and projects out for anyone to see / critique. I'm very interested in keeping with Javascript and back end development. I have picked up programming over the last 2 years and absolutley love it. My goal is to try and do this full time. I have also writting hundreds of batch scripts and games on Windows. It may be ancient but it's a challenge and I really enjoy that as well.</p>
